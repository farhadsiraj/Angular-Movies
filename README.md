# farhadFlix

farhadFLIX is a website built with TypeScript and Angular that fetches and displays data from The Movie Database. Users can browse Movies and TV Shows by genre or search for a specific title. Once a movie or show is selected users can view the overview tab to see details about the movie/show and photos of the cast. Other tabs include official video trailers, images, and reviews from users of TMDB.

I used SCSS for the styling, Angular Animations for the slider component, and PrimeNG for the Tabs, Carousel, Sliders, Pagination, Video Player, and Image Gallery. I also used RXjS to handle asynchronous data calls from TMDB API.
